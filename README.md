<h2>About Abyssal Fawn</h2>
Abyssal Fawn (pronounced /əˈbisəl fôn/) is a custom Discord theme designed for both the desktop and mobile experiences. The theme is characterised by its primarily blue apperance which composes most of the theme. Though brown is used for notifications and other smaller parts to act as a highlight.

>[!NOTE]
>The Abyssal Fawn theme is not completely finished, this is more to act as a public beta to allow users to test out the theme and give their thoughts and critisms about. If you notice any issues with the theme, please create a Issue on the github or contact me on Discord @ t1u (preferably the former.)

<h2>How to Install</h2>

To use custom themes on the mobile client, you'll need to use <a href="https://vendetta.rocks">Vendetta</a> (or its forks like <a href="https://github.com/pyoncord/Bunny">Bunny</a> or <a href="https://github.com/revenge-mod/Revenge">Revenge</a> or any similar client modification tool available on iOS or Android (note that whilist a verision for Aliucord is planned, it almost certiantly wont work as is.)

<h3>Stylus</h3>
Abyssal Fawn is not officially provided for the web version of Discord. The desktop version may work on web but an official step-by-step guide and listing will be provided once testing can be done to ensure that it works on the web version. 
<h3>Aliucord</h3>
Aliucord is not officially provided for Aliucord due to it using an older version of the Discord client then Vendetta uses. An Aliucord version is planned to be released eventually.
