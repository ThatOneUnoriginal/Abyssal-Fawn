<h2>About Abyssal Fawn</h2>
Abyssal Fawn (pronounced /əˈbisəl fôn/) is a custom Discord theme designed for both the desktop and mobile experiences. The theme is characterised by its primarily blue apperance which composes most of the theme. Though brown is used for notifications and other smaller parts to act as a highlight.

>[!NOTE]
>The Abyssal Fawn theme is not completely finished, this is more to act as a public beta to allow users to test out the theme and give their thoughts and critisms about. If you notice any issues with the theme, please create a Issue on the github or contact me on Discord @ t1u (preferably the former.)

>Right now whilist similar, there are some differences with the Abyssal Fawn theme on Desktop and Mobile. Whilst some of these differences are due to the slight changes in desktop and mobile Discord design, the intention is to make them as similar as possible. So you may see slight changes in how both themes appear over time due to this reason.
